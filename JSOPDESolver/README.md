# JSOPDESolver

```
using Gridap, Krylov
```

Set of codes to use JSOSolvers tools to solve partial differential equations
modeled with Gridap. It contains examples of:
* using Krylov.jl to solve linear PDEs (`AffineFEOperator`)
* using Krylov.jl to solve the linear systems in the Newton-loop to solve
nonlinear PDEs.
* more...

Pluto notebook examples can be found in the pluto folder.
